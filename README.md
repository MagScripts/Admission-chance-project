## Project Topic:
Machine learning for Predicting the chances of students getting admitted to Universities in the U.S based on certain criteria. 

## Dataset Description:
This dataset  comprises of 400 rows and 9 columns and no missing data. 

## Techniques:
There was no missing data in the dataset however, some cleaning was carried out involving the renaming of some columns. 

## Model Development:
A linear regression model was initially used to build a model which was used to predict the chances of being admitted . The Linear regression had a 68% precision and as a result, multiple models were developed to see the best fit model. The models used include:
  - Elastic Regressor
  - Random Forest Regresssor
  - Ada Boost Regressor
  - Voting Regressor
  - Ridge Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - KNeighbors Regressor
  - 
## Model Deployment:
The model was deployed on Gradio and performed excellently
